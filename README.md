# CLI-PLAY
#
# A tool for making playlists in the command line.
#
# Motivation:
#
# I have always liked make playlists. But I don't necessarily always want to open itunes or spotify for it. Those are for playlists that are ready to go. But if I want to experiment and try many different combinations, specifically with my own unfinished tracks, then i don't think those are the right tools.
#
# Benefits:
#
# Scriptable - You could easily use cli-play to write scripts that will generate thousands of playlists. Just supply the logic/model for your playlist and cli-play can generate them in an efficient and manageable way.
